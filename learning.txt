es, you're correct that even if the dictionary returned by get_current_device_user has the same structure (keys and values) as the schemas.DeviceTokenData Pydantic model, it still won't work as expected when you try to access attributes like token_data.user_id. This is because Pydantic models and plain Python dictionaries are fundamentally different in how they handle attribute access, and FastAPI's dependency system relies on this distinction.
